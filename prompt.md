With this plan of modification @plan.md implement task N.

Run everything yourself. Notice that all the tasks before this one were finished, you can infer the state of the project from that. Only report back after you've succeeded or to say you found a roadblock. After finishing, add the word **Implemented** to the plan section you worked on and add "result" section to the respective part of the plan, specifying which files were added or modified as a result and what they do - one line the most.

Do not stop until the exact quantifiable result from the task was achieved (usually by running the code), or until you hit a roadblock, as in you discovered something that prevents you from achieving the quantifiable result.
